# Coronavirus-Simulation
 A simulation of how the Coronavirus spreads, coded in C++ for Windows. The code requires C++ 17 to work, any older version won't work whatsoever. Visual Studio supports C++ 17 by default, so you won't have to mind this if you're developing in Visual Studio.
 #### Feel free to use the code however you like. But I simply ask you to credit me if you decide to use this in a report or any other sort of work.
 Any contribution would be greatly appriciated.
