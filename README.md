# Coronavirus-Simulation
 A simulation of how the Coronavirus spreads, coded in C++ for Windows. The code requires C++ 17 to work, any older version won't work whatsoever. Visual Studio supports C++ 17 by default, so you won't have to mind this if you're developing in Visual Studio. There are a fair bit of improvements to be made, but if you're looking to learn about simulations that don't use AI this is a great starting point.
 #### Feel free to use the code however you like. But I simply ask you to credit me if you decide to use this in a report or any other sort of work.
 Any contribution would be greatly appriciated.
